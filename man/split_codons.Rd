\title{Split a nucleotide sequence into codons}
\usage{
split_codons(sequence, start = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequence}{A character string representing a nucleotide sequence.
Should contain only A, T/U, C, or G characters.}

\item{start}{A numeric value giving the position in the sequence
where the reading frame begins. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A character vector of codons extracted from the input sequence.
        Codons are returned left-to-right based on the specified frame.
}
\description{
Takes a DNA or RNA sequence as a character string and returns a vector
of codons (groups of three bases) based on a specified reading frame.
}
